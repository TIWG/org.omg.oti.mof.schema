== What is not represented? ==

=== Well-formedness contraints (e.g. OCL) ===

  It is necessary to have a representation of a model before one can decide whether it is well-formed or not
  relative to constraints.

  Note that some structural well-formedness constraints are implicitly captured in
  the syntax of metaclasses & associations.

== What is represented? ==

=== The definition of an M2 metamodel (e.g. UML, BPMN, CWM, ...) ===

  Note that the OMG UML 2.5 metamodel is distinct from a tool-specific implementation of it
  (e.g., MD 18's UML2.5 metamodel; Eclipse 5.0's UML 2.5 metamodel)

  Defining a MOF metamodel is, roughly, specifying the set of:

  - Metaclasses
  - CMOF directed associations (composite or reference, ordered or unordered)
  - Primitive types and/or Enumerations
  - Data property attributes defined in the context of a metaclass and typed by a primitive or enumeration data type

=== The definition of a profile that extends an M2 metamodel (e.g. SysML, ...) ===

  Defining a profile for a given M2 metamodel is, roughly, specifying the set of:

  - The extended metamodel (this can be any M2 metamodel, see UML 2.5, 12.3.3.2)
  - Stereotypes (the metaclasses that are extended by a particular stereotype)
  - CMOF directed associations among stereotypes

=== The content of an M1 model as an instance of an M2 metamodel possibly extended by the application of profiles ===

  This content is, roughly, specifying the set of:

  - Element metaclasses (an element is an instance of a metamodel-defined metaclass)
  - Metamodel association links (metaclass instances can be related via link instances of associations relating
    their respective metaclasses)
  - Applied stereotypes (an element can have zero or more profile-defined stereotypes applied)
  - Metamodel & profile data property values

=== All metamodels, profiles & models are artifacts that serialized to or deserialized from a located resource. ===
