\begin_layout Abstract
This paper advocates for a unification of modeling & programming from the
 perspective of normalized, implementation-neutral database schemas: representin
g programs and models in terms of irreducible and independent tables.
 This idea departs from the mainstream of modeling & programming, which
 typically revolves around Application Program Interface (API) ecosystems
 for operational needs and external serialization for interchange needs.
 Instead, this idea emphasizes an information-centric architecture to separate
 the structural aspects of language syntax via normalized schema tables
 from the operational aspects of language syntax and semantics via programs
 operating on normalized tables or derived table views.
 Such tables constitute the basis of a functional information architecture
 unifying modeling and programming as a radical departure from standardizing
 APIs in a programming fashion or standardizing serialization interchange
 in a modeling fashion.
 This paper focuses on the current API-less serialization-centric modeling
 paradigm because it is the farthest from a unified functional information
 architecture compared to functional programming languages where thinking
 about programs as pure functions and models as pure data is closest to
 this kind of unification.
 This paper first deconstructs the multi-level, reflective architecture
 for modeling languages defined at the Object Management Group (OMG) based
 on the Meta-Object Facility (MOF) and the Unified Modeling Language (UML)
 and subsequently reconstructs several normalized schema accounting for
 the information content and organization of different kinds of resources
 involved in modeling: libraries of datatypes, metamodels like UML, profiles
 like the Systems Modeling Language (SysML) that extend metamodels and models
 that conform to metamodels optionally extended with applied profiles.

\begin_layout Section
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Between 2010 and 2015, the value proposition of OMG's core modeling specificatio
ns for the Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) community of tool vendors
 and users improved dramatically from 2010 with MOF 2.0, UML 2.3, SysML 1.1
 and XMI 2.1.1 to 2015 with MOF 2.5, UML 2.5, SysML 1.4, XMI 2.5.1.
 As NASA's representative at the OMG, the author was a key contributor to
 improvements made, including simplifying the reflective modeling architecture
 (UML is a metamodel defined in MOF, which is an extended subset of UML),
 mechanically verifying UML against MOF's well-formedness constraints, support
 for IEC/ISO 80000 metrology including dimensional analysis of quantity
 calculus equations, and a simplified serialization scheme where some models
 can have a predictable Canonical XMI serialization independently of the
 tool that produced it.
 In addition to these tactical improvements, the OMG made strategic improvements
 with programming language inspired specification for a foundational subset
 for executable UML (FUML) with a Java-like concrete syntax in the Action
 Language for FUML (ALF).
 These improvements fueled a growing adoption of UML/SysML based MBSE methodolog
ies in flagship space mission projects at NASA like the missions to Mars
 and Europa scheduled for 2020.
 Despite these improvements, there is a considerable gap between the quality
 of OMG's current modeling specifications and that of state-of-the-art modern
 programming language specifications.
 This gap reflects the significant difference between OMG's document-centric
 processes and the formal methods techniques that are de rigeur in programming
 language design.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
OMG's document-centric processes were sufficient for the 2010 era of modeling
 specifications since their value proposition was primarily based on using
 modeling diagrams for communication purposes among human stakeholders.
 Indeed, OMG's practices for describing the syntax of a language have been
 widely adopted even for other standards like W3C's OWL2 Structural Specificatio
n where the functional syntax of OWL2 is normatively defined in terms of
 a simplified subset of UML class diagrams.
 For UML 1.0 and the major revision in UML 2.0, describing the UML in terms
 of UML class diagrams helped the OMG reach consensus among the competing
 interests of OMG tool vendors involved.
 However, the ubiquitousness of UML class diagrams and the familiarity with
 the core modeling constructs involved (Associations, Classes and Properties)
 hides significant complexity due to conceptual redundancy (e.g., an association
 could be modeled as a class with properties), semantic variability (e.g.,
 only binary associations can have composite ends; however, their ends can
 be owned by associations or classes) and meaning scattered across several
 specifications including MOF, UML, the Object Constraint Language (OCL)
 and the XML Metadata Interchange (XMI).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After the 2015 era, the document-centric process is inadequate for addressing
 in a cost effective manner the strategic issues about the poorly specified
 syntax and semantics of OMG's modeling specifications.
 Although the OMG modeling architecture distinguishes between abstract syntax
 and serialization, the relationship between abstract syntax and serialization
 is both complicated and incompletely addressed topic in OMG's specifications.
 For example, the XMI specification describes the rules for serialization
 in EBNF but there are no rules specified for parsing XMI into an abstract
 syntax representation.
 In contrast, W3C's OWL2 Structural Specification includes normative criteria
 for parsing the serialization of an ontology into an instance of the abstract
 syntax model and for testing the structural equivalence among arbitrary
 abstract syntax objects.
 Given the widespread interoperability of OWL2 ontologies across multiple
 serialization syntaxes and the poort interoperability of UML/SysML models
 across tool-specific varians of a single XMI serialization syntax, there
 is a legitimate basis to revisit the fundamental tenets of OMG's modeling
 architecture.

Background: MOF-based metamodeling is too complex
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Several factors contribute to the complexity and inadequacy of MOF as architectu
re for metamodeling and modeling:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Poor separation between the abstract syntax of a metamodel in MOF and its
 serialization mapping to XMI.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The reflective MOF architecture lacks a bootstrapping or a fixedpoint foundation
 for a unified syntax and semantics of all kinds of models in this architecture
 (e.g., metamodels, profiles, models, queries, transformations).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Convoluted semantics for the core metamodeling constructs (Associations,
 Classes, Generalizations, Properties) due to poor separation of concerns
 and loose syntax.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Poor separation of concerns between entity and relationship constructs invites
 significant conceptual redundancy and variability in their use.
 For example, a relationship among entities may be modeled via several patterns
 of fundamental constructs: as an association (with association end properties),
 as properties of the related entities (without an association), as a (relations
hip) class with properties or as even more redundant combinations of the
 above.
 Since the Object Management Group (OMG) uses MOF for defining metamodels,
 construct redundancy affects all OMG metamodels like the Unified Modeling
 Language (UML) where redundancy leads to significant variability in the
 way conceptual relationships are defined in the UML metamodel.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The UML metamodel is defined in terms of MOF classes, associations and propertie
s.
 A MOF class in a metamodel for a modeling langauge represents a concept
 in that language.
 There is no terminology consensus for what MOF associations and properties
 represent in the modeling language.
 The metaclasses in the UML metamodel are organized in a classification
 taxonomy with a single root metaclass, UML Element, which is the toplevel
 concept in UML for a constituent of a model.
 All the other metaclasses in the UML metamodel are directly or indirectly
 classified as a kind of UML Element.
 For example, a UML Relationship is a kind of UML Element specifying some
 kind of relationship between other UML Elements.
 Unfortunately, The UML Relationship metaclass does not classify all of
 the UML metaclasses that conceptually represent some kind of relationship
 in the language, for example:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
In the graph of a UML Interaction, the GeneralOrdering metaclass represents
 a directed relationship from an OccurrenceSpecification to another.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
In the graph of a UML Activity, the ActivityEdge metaclass represents a
 directed relationship from an ActivityNode to another.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
In the graph of a UML StateMachine, the Transition metaclass represents
 a directed relationship from a Vertex to another.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
In the graph of a UML Interaction, the Message metaclass represents a trace
 relationship between send and receive events.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
In UML class diagrams, the Dependency metaclass represents a relationship
 among client/supplier NamedElements.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
In the graph of a UML StructuredClassifier, the Connector metaclass represents
 a join relationship among ConnectorEnds.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
In UML class diagrams, the Association metaclass represents an N-ary relationshi
p among Classifiers.

summarizes the characteristics of seven metaclasses intended to represent
 conceptual relationships in UML.
 Even though UML defines a Relationship metaclass, some conceptual relationships
 are not a kind of UML Relationship! (cases 1-4, 6).
 An intrinsic aspect of a conceptual relationship is to differentiate what
 it relates; that is, the relationship roles
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Without roles, a conceptual relationship would degenerate to a conceptual
 group of undifferentiated conceptual elements.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 Such roles are represented in two ways: as a combination of distinct role
 properties (D) without role binding (-B) (see cases 1-5) or as a combination
 of a single ordered role (S) with role metaclass (R) and role binding (B)
 (see cases 6,7).
 Additionally, there is considerable variation in the way opposite roles
 are modeled (or not) (see +Op, Od, -O), even for a single conceptual relationsh
ip! (see Dependency which has +Od, +Op).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This analysis of only 7 out of 242 metaclasses highlights significant problems
 in UML: mismatch between intent and definition; hetereogeneous syntactic
 pattern representations; and heterogeneous terminological descriptions

\begin_layout Plain Layout
A GeneralOrdering represents a binary relation...; An ActivityEdge is an abstract

 A Connector specifies links...; An Association classifies a set of links...
 A link is a tuple of values...
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 Such problems are clearly undesirable characteristics of languages -- programmi
ng or modeling -- because they increase the complexity of the language.
 Defining programming languages in terms of grammars for their syntax and
 of type systems for their semantics has been enormously helpful for improving
 programming languages.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some problems of conceptual mismatches and syntactical heterogeneity date
 back to UML 1.0 (e.g., Message, Transition) and persist two decades later
 in UML 2.5; other problems were introduced in the major UML 2.0 revision
 a decade ago (e.g.
 Connector, GeneralOrdering).
 The fact that these problems involve a relatively small set of syntactic
 constructs for metamodeling (Class, Property, Association, Generalization)
 indicates that MOF-based metamodeling (including OCL) has been and remains
 ineffective for designing metamodels compared to the techniques used for
 designing programming languages, in particular, language grammars and type
 systems.
 Poor choice of syntactic terminology in UML further exacerbates these problems.
 For example, the conceptual relationship of 'typing' is well understood
 in programming languages; however, in UML, type is a homonym for two different
 kinds of relationships with different semantics: the 'type' of a TypedElement
 (e.g.
 Property) is a Type (e.g.
 Class, Association) and the 'type' of a Connector is an Association; however,
 a Connector is not a kind of TypedElement.
 The root cause of these problems stems from a small set of metamodeling
 constructs that can be combined into many syntactic patterns that in turn
 have been used for similar yet subtly different conceptual or semantic
 purposes; that is, excessive syntactic complexity.
 Records of issue resolutions from OMG task forces provide ample historical
 evidence about this complexity including difficulties encountered with
 subtle variations in these patterns and with correcting mismatches between
 intent and definition.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Historically, the cost of finding and correcting these discrepancies has
 been very high in terms of the man/years of effort by OMG task forces and
 by tool vendors implementing revisions of OMG specifications.
 Experience suggests that the current OMG processes for revising OMG specificati
ons incur significant missed opportunity costs because of the lack of pragmatic
 rigor in exploiting modern computer science techniques for rigorous specificati
on development, in particular:

\begin_layout Standard
OMG modeling specifications define conformance criteria that amount to well-form
edness criteria; they do not define any kind of behavior that an implementation
 must conform to such as parsing or serializing models to/from external
 representations.
 Programming languages typically have only one concrete syntax and the grammar
 specifies the parsing from concrete to abstract syntax.
 A modeling language can have multiple concrete syntaxes; consequently,
 parsing & serialization should be specified and tested.
 This has never been done at the OMG, not even for XMI! However, it has
 been done for W3C's OWL2 Structural Specification, a descriptive modeling
 language

 Alf is an exception at the OMG.

\begin_layout Standard
The OMG publication process requires every OMG modeling specification to
 specify criteria of conformance to the specification.
 Such criteria pertain to notions of abstract and concrete syntax, model
 interchange, diagram interchange and semantics.
 Historically, these process requirements have been poorly effective because
 the OMG modeling architecture provides no standard interoperable way to
 represent the syntax of an arbitrary model in an arbitrary modeling language
 and consequently no implementation-neutral way to assess the conformance
 an implementation to an OMG specification.
 This paper proposes starting with breaking the reflective language definition
 paradigm adopted for UML and MOF.
 This requires a drastic simplification and refactoring of the fundamental
 constructs for metamodeling.

\begin_layout Subsection
Which of the three concepts is redundant?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The MOF concepts of Class, Association and Property are redundant for defining
 metamodels.
 Which of these three can be eliminated? MOF Class is a first-class concept
 in metamodels: every element in a model must be an instance of at least
 one metaclass defined in a metamodel that the model conforms to.
 It is debatable whether MOF Property or Association needs first-class status.
 MOF Property is a first-class concept in the Eclipse Modeling Framework
 (EMF).
 However, full support for binary MOF Associations requires a suitable EMF
 code generator represent them in EMF without loss of information.
 In terms of OMG's MOF 2.5 and EMF 2.12, there are three variations of binary
 MOF Associations to consider: 1) metaclass-owned association end properties;
 2) one association-owned end and one metaclass-owned end; 3) association-owned
 ends.
 EMF directly supports case (1) only: metaclass-owned association end properties
 are represented as opposite EMF
\family typewriter

\begin_inset space \space{}
\end_inset

EReferences
\family default
 to update the opposite when one end is updated.
 The other two cases depend on the EMF code generator used.
 For example, the Eclipse UML code generator adds to each metaclass that
 is the type of an association-owned end property an EMF annotation that
 effectively acts as if the association-owned end property were instead
 owned by that metaclass.
 Since full association support depends on EMF code generation techniques,

 For cases (2,3), API-based navigation requires knowledge of the code generation

, the above analysis should suffice to claim that EMF is insufficient for
 code-generation agnostic API-based navigation of models according to all
 three cases of Complete MOF (CMOF) binary associations.
 Therefore, one must conclude that EMF's choice of class+property as first-class
 concepts turns out to be insufficient for CMOF metamodeling.

Symmetric subsetting means that link instances of an association with subsetting
 ends must be also link instances of the other associations with the subsetted
 ends.
 This implies that an association with subsetting ends effectively specializes
 the associations whose ends are subsetted.
 Like subsetting, redefinition has a semantics of association specialization
 but with an additional forcing semantics in the contexts of the redefining
 ends: In such contexts, the redefining ends replace the redefined ends.
 This means that in such contexts, it is not possible to create link instances
 of the associations with redefined ends because such links must be instead
 instances of the association with redefining ends.

.
 Historically, this redundancy was rationalized on the basis that the operation
 query enables specifying the derivation rule in OCL while the association
 end property enables specifying the availability of the derived property.
 This redundancy also creates confusion: a derived association has both
 a derived metaclass-owned end (e.g.
 
\family typewriter
Classifier::/inheritedMember
\family default
) and a non-derived association-owned end! Since a derived association are
 intended to provide notation for derived OCL queries, it makes sense to
 eliminate the redundant derived associations (e.g.
 
\family typewriter
Classifier::/inheritedMember
\family default
) , keeping only the OCL derived queries.

Although the concept of association is a first-class construct for defining
 metamodels, the OMG made significant changes to the concept of association
 end property.
 The UML 1.x and MOF 1.x specifications used the term 'property' in a general
 sense for any of three distinct kinds of metaclasses: AssociationEnd (i.e.,
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "enu:associationEnd"

\end_inset

), Attribute (i.e.,
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "enu:attribute"

\end_inset

) and TaggedValue (not described in this paper).
 As part of the major 2.0 revision, these three metaclasses were replaced
 with a single one, Property.
 Although a few 1.x distinctions were encoded as MOF constraints, the major
 revision lost the 1.x separation between AssociationEnd and Attribute.
 The 2.0 revision added support for the object-oriented paradigm where an
 association end Property can be owned by a Class or by an Association.
 Class-owned association end Properties enabled support for Essential MOF
 metamodels where the semantics of a binary Association is defined in terms
 of its Class-owned Properties only
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
after "See section 6.4"
key "EMF"

\end_inset

.
 Historically, the 2.0 major revisions of UML and MOF were adopted in 2003
 and finalized in 2005; at least a year before the finalization of the 2.0
 major revision of OCL was finalized in 2006.
 OCL 2.0 emphasized the operational aspects of querying association end propertie
s regardless of their ownership by a class or association.
 This emphasis is so important for OCL that it has been a compliance point
 ever since.
 OCL's emphasis on the query semantics of navigating association end properties
 stands in contrast with UML's emphasis on the value semantics of association
 end properties and on the class/property object oriented view of associations.
 Later in 2010, the Foundational subset for executable UML (FUML) specification
 emphasized the lifecycle aspects of creating and deleting link instances
 of associations based on the existing UML action semantics.
 FUML in fact requires associations to own all of their ends but unlike
 the misconception from the object-oriented paradigm, supports operating
 on association end properties from related classes as if such ends were
 class-owned features.
 However, FUML does not give association links a similar status as that
 of class instances because FUML restricts the classifier queried by a UML
 ReadExtentAction to be a class only.
 The rest of this section explains the basis for simplifying CMOF meta associati
ons in terms of the three aspects of association end properties that have
 historically been the source of much complexity, confusion and errors in
 OMG specifications: aggregation, ordering and subsetting/redefinition.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Simplifying and promoting aggregation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since Property::aggregation has a significant effect on the semantics of
 association end properties, the difference is elevated to the conceptual
 level instead of being represented in terms of the Property::aggregation
 attribute as in current MOF, UML and FUML.
 Hence, the refactoring of the relevant subset of the CMOF abstract syntax
 metamodel shown in Fig.
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:RefactoredCMOF"

\end_inset

 distinguishes the roles of a CMOF property with respect to typing like
 UML 1.x and MOF 1.x did (DataProperty corresponds to case
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "enu:attribute"

\end_inset

 and AssociationEnd to case
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "enu:associationEnd"

\end_inset

) and, in the latter case, further distinguishes the roles of CMOF MetaAssociati
on and of MetaAssociationEnd with respect to aggregation (this distinction
 has no counterpart in past & current OMG specifications).
 Like UML 1.x and FUML, association ends are semantically owned features
 of their association.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "sub:Simplifying-association-end"

\end_inset

Simplifying association end ordering
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Although association ends have always been ordered in UML 1.x and 2.x, this
 syntactic ordering is independent from all the other characteristics of
 association ends (aggregation, ownership, navigability and multiplicity).
 In practice, such characteristics are typically used to explain the intended
 ordering instead of using the notation for the association end ordering
 (see
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
after "Section 11.5.4"
key "UML 2.5"

\end_inset

.
 The refactored CMOF metamodel is designed to be compatible with current
 metamodeling practices, in particular, it reflects the practice of infering
 association end ordering from their characteristics according to the following
 prioritized criteria:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The target end is composite, the source end is not.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The source end is owned by the association, the target end by a metaclass.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Both ends are owned by the association, the source end is navigable, the
 target end isn't.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Both ends are not composite, the source end is unbounded, the target end
 has a finite upper bound.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The source end (resp.
 the target end) directly or indirectly subsets or redefines another source
 end (resp.
 target end).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
If none of the above applies, the source and target ends are respectively
 the first and second properties in the ordered member end collection.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Instead of carrying such complex criteria, the refactored CMOF metamodel
 explicitly differentiates at the metaclass level the source and target
 association ends.
 That is, the ordering of the association ends for a current MOF 2.5 binary
 association must be determined according to the six criteria above whereas
 in the refactored CMOF metamodel, the ordering is explicitly represented
 in differentiated metaclasses, i.e.
 MetaAssociationSourceEnd and MetaAssociationTargetEnd.
 Additional simplifications were possible thanks to the asymmetry of aggregation
, which is only relevant for an association target end.
 Since aggregation has profound semantic implications for the lifecycle
 semantics of classifiers and their instances, it is an essential characteritic
 distinguishing MetaAssociationTarget{Composite,Reference}End.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Simplifying subsetting and redefinition
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After the UML 2.0 major revision, the relationship between association specializa
tion and association end subsetting or redefinition were poorly understood.
 This topic was the subject of intense scrutiny in the UML 2.4.1 revision
 because hundreds of errors were traced to inconsistent and/or incorrect
 subsets and/or redefinitions.
 Unfortunately, a clear explanation is missing from the UML 2.5 simplification.
 Here, the refactored CMOF metamodel reflects a unified ontological view
 of meta associations as relationships that classify related metaclasses
 in terms of named roles.
 In this ontological view, subsetting and redefinition have the semantics
 of restricting the subsetted or redefined association respectively.
 More precisely, AssociationGeneralization with source and target restriction=fa
lse corresponds to existential subsetting; that is, the weak restriction
 that a link classified by the specialized (i.e.
 subsetting) association must be some link classified by the general (i.e.
 subsetted) association.
 AssociationGeneralization with source or target restriction=true corresponds
 to a universal redefinition; that is, the strong restriction that all links
 classified by the general association (i.e., with the redefined source and/or
 target end) must also be classified by the specific association (i.e.
 with the redefining source and/or target end.)

correspond to UML PackageImport and ProfileApplication augmented with programmin
g language-like semantics (cross-references from one resource to another
 are well-formed if and only if there is a corresponding import relationship)
 and kinding restrictions (e.g., importation is homogeneous for libraries,
 models and metamodels; profiles can import either profiles or metamodels).
 The kinding restrictions induce three layers of resources: 1) libraries
 that can acyclically import each other; 2) metamodels and profiles that
 can acyclically import each other and use libraries and 3) models that
 can acyclically import each other and that must conform to at least one
 metamodel or profile (ProfileApplication-like semantics) and transitively
 to any other resource directly or indirectly imported or used.
 Conformance for a model means that all of the elements, links and values
 in the model extent must be conforming instances of meta classes, meta
 associations, stereotypes and datatypes defined in the defined in the metamodel
s, profiles and libraries that the model directly or indirectly conforms
 to.

 In contrast to OMG modeling specifications, including variants of MOF and
 UML, that allow defining datatypes anywhere and that result in significant
 duplication, the approach described here promotes a clean separation of
 concerns for entities and relationships pertaining to the definition of
 conceptual vs.
 data vocabularies.
 Conceptual vocabularies are the exclusive province of metamodels and profiles.
 Data vocabularies are the exclusive province of libraries.
 These two categories of vocabularies are seldom separated despite having
 fundamentally very different kinds of semantics: the semantics of conceptual
 vocabularies is about identified instances of sortal entities and of their
 relationships via formal roles whereas the semantics of data vocabularies
 is based on structural equivalence of structured datatype values and equality
 of atomic datatype values.
 Note that a StructuredValue carries an identity criteria, uuid.
 This is a deliberate choice for simplifying change management from the
 complexity of OMG's XMI tree-based serialization to the simplicity of adding/de
leting rows for entity, attribute or relationship tables where a row is
 comprised of a tuple of key values (uuids) or lexical representations of
 values of atomic datatypes

 via examples of XMI serialization, this paper defines an abstract syntax
 for stereotypes applied to elements and their so-called tag property values
 as shown in Fig.

: AppliedStereotype is an optional classification of a ModelElement as an
 instance of the Stereotype applied; that is, values of Stereotype attributes
 are represented with the same mechanism as are values of MetaClass attributes
 (i.e., ModelElementAttributeValue).
 This avoids the complexity of the CMOF-equivalent semantics of Extensions
 as Associations while retaining the intent of the CMOF-equivalent semantics
 of a Stereotype as a CMOF class that can be optionally applied to an element
 via the AppliedStereotype optional role.

 The OMG stopped this practice based on the recommendation from the UML

\begin_inset Quotes eld

retire 'Model Interchange Using CORBA IDL' as an adopted technology because
 of lack of vendor and user interest.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 As part of the 2.0 major revision, the OMG also switched from XML DTDs to
 XML Schema to support validating models serialized as XML Documents against
 their metamodel XML Schemas.
 Several factors contribute to persistent problems of poor model interchange
 with XMI: the document production rules specified in English and BNF allowed
 for many serialization options that increased the complexity of XMI implementat
ions to recognize them when loading XMI documents produced from other tools;
 since the schema production rules have yet to be applied to UML2.x, tool
 vendors and user continue to accrue missed opportunity costs due to the
 inability to validate XMI documents against official XMI schemas.
 The OMG is keenly aware of these issues.
 Recent improvements made in Canonical XMI 2.5 minimize but do not eliminate
 serialization variability and promote but do not ensure serialization reproduci
bility.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Normalization yields simpler tabular serialization
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The fundamental source of complexity and poor interchange stems from a design
 decision in the XMI 2.x specification to represent MOF's exclusive ownership
 principle in terms of nested XML elements: The resulting tree serialization
 of a model is a materialized view of the model's ownership structure.
 XML trees are inherently ill-suited for large-scale model management because
 comparing trees is computationally expensive even with the state-of-the-art
 Robust Tree Edit Distance (RTED) algorithm whose cubic worst-case runtime
 complexity is optimal
\begin_inset space \textvisiblespace{}
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 This means that comparing serialized models becomes practically unreasonable
 for models with millions of elements.

 will provide tangible model interchange benefits for end users compared
 to the current serialization paradigm based on XMI trees due to the improved
 efficiency of comparing models serialized as normalized tables vs.
 trees.
 Comparing trees is computationally expensive: the Robust Tree Edit Distance
 (RTED) algorithm has a worst-case cubic runtime complexity

 that is impractical for large models with millions of elements.
 Comparing normalized tables reduces is computationally reasonable thanks

 even for models with billions of elements (rows)

 with the added benefit that distributed version control systems like GIT
 should report precise and accurate changes since differences reduce to
 additions and deletions of table rows.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This switch has a subtle but important implication on the representation
 of cross references.
 Since the 2.0 major revision, the OMG XMI specification has distinguished
 cross-references within a document vs.
 across documents.
 In the former case, a cross reference is represented as an XML idref for
 the XML id of the locally referenced element.
 In the latter case, the XMI specification allows for five different representat
ions for a cross reference in terms of XML id, XMI uuid, label or potentially
 arbitrary XLink and XPointer expressions.
 Most tools follow OMG's serialization practices that rely on XML idref
 for local and cross references (the XML idref becomes a fragment for an
 href).
 Historically, the multitude of options and technologies involved for representi
ng basic element cross references has been a significant source of poor
 model interchange across tools.
 Switching to a normalized serialization strategy eliminates altogether
 the distinction for local vs.
 cross references and the options for representing them because all elements
 are referenced, locally or externally, via their uuid.
 The fact that cross references are represented uniformly regardless of
 whether they are local or not means that the representation of the normalized
 serialization is independent of its organization in one or multiple documents.
 The fact that the normalized serialization produces tabular data without
 empty columns means that it is possible to take advantage of modern data
 analytics frameworks for processing model data because the form and content
 of normalized tabular data is independent of how it is organized in terms
 of documents.
 This is a significant advantage compared to OMG's XMI tree-based serialization
 where the form and content of the serialized representation depends on
 its organization in terms of one or more documents and on their location
 and vice-versa.

 However, their modeling APIs are incompatible, not only because of differences

; however these have nothing in common except for EMF's EObject and Notifier
 interfaces.
 In fact, this example illustrates some subtle differences that cause significan
t API-level interoperability problems when working with EMF-based technologies
 with these two modeling tools:

\end_inset

.
 However, only the generated Eclipse UML metaclasses inherit from EModelElement,
 the generated MagicDraw UML metaclasses don't.
 This difference means that many EMF-based techniques that assume that every
 model element can be annotated will not work as intended when operating
 on MagicDraw UML models unlike their Eclipse UML counterparts.

\begin_layout Itemize
Comparing class attributes corresponding to association ends in the Eclipse
 UML and MagicDraw UML APIs can be difficult; it is particularly helpful
 to have knowledge of the particular EMF code generation techniques involved
 to recognize the tool-specific correspondences between CMOF association
 ends defined in the OMG UML 2.5 metamodel and their corresponding EMF representa
tion in terms of EReferences and/or EOperations in the generated tool-specific
 APIs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The root cause of non-existent API-level model interoperability stems from
 the lack of distinction between two different kinds of APIs: abstract syntax
 vs.
 information content schema:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
An abstract syntax API provides support for creating, deleting, updating
 and navigating across model elements and data according to metaclasses,
 stereotypes, associations and datatypes defined in metamodels, profiles
 and libraries.
 The MOF Abstract Semantics chapter is the closest specification available
 from the OMG for such APIs, which are the basis for higher-level APIs for
 model query (e.g.
 OCL) and transformation (e.g QVT).
 The operational nature of MOF Abstract Semantics, OCL and QVT should enable
 the OMG to modernize their specification with modern program development
 techniques for library design, unit testing and integration.
 Some of this is already underway thanks to the programming-language centric
 development process used for the Eclipse OCL & QVT implementations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
A normalized schema data API provides support for internally representing
 the information content of a model at an API level independently of its
 external representation in one of possibly multiple serializations (e.g.
 XMI, RDF, OWL, Json, CSV, ...).
 The schemas described in Sec.

.
 Normalization yields tables where each column corresponds to an essential
 characteristic (a primary key, a foreign key, an attribute); which in turns
 simplifies serialization matters because there are no optional values and
 no nulls.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Metamodeling frameworks like EMF provide support for generating abstract
 syntax APIs (and implementations) from metamodels and profiles (e.g., the
 Eclipse UML tooling).
 It is likely that OMG's emphasis on XMI Schemas in the major 2.0 revision
 of MOF, UML and XMI is responsible for deemphasizing the importance of
 specifying the information content of models explicitly as is done in this
 paper.
 A significant advantage of the normalized schema APIs described in this
 paper stems from the possibility of leveraging modern data processing framework
s like Apache Spark for scaling up complex model transformation workflows
 as described in Fig.

 In contrast to the affinity of the normalized schemas for optimization

Summary
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This paper makes three significant contributions towards addressing significant
 issues with the current paradigm for developing modeling specifications
 at the OMG.
 First, this paper carefully explained the intrinsic sources of complexity
 in OMG's reflexive metamodeling architecture (MOF) where the notion of
 a profile does not cleanly fit the multi-layered modeling architecture.
 It is noteworthy that most of the complexity stems from the multiple roles
 that the concept of property plays in specifying libraries (datatype attributes
), metamodels (association ends) and profiles (stereotype association ends).
 Second, this paper reconstructs a considerably simpler set of schemas for
 specifying the information content of all modeling artifacts including
 models that instantiate metamodels with optionally applied profiles.
 Focusing on the information content instead of the abstract syntax API
 is key to a significant simplification compared to the current specification
 practices where a single abstract syntax is used for both generating an
 API and for tree-based serialization.
 Third, the paper only sketched a promising area for future work: leveraging
 powerful data analytics platforms for scaling up complex modeling workflows
 thanks to the affinity of normalized schemas for optimization and concurrency.
